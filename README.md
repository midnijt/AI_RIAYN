# Title of the Project

This project implements the regularization techniques proposed in the paper [insert paper title here] on the scikit-learn's California housing dataset. The goal of this project is to compare the performance of regularized Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks with the traditional ML method XGBoost.

## Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X.X)
- NumPy (version X.X.X)
- Pandas (version X.X.X)
- Scikit-learn (version X.X.X)
- PyTorch (version X.X.X)
- [insert any other dependencies here]

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Experiments

To run the experiments, navigate to the `src` directory and run:

```
python main.py
```

This will train and evaluate the regularized MLP networks and XGBoost on the California housing dataset. The results will be printed to the console and saved to a CSV file in the `results` directory.

## Results

[Insert a brief summary of the results here. You can also include tables or figures to show the results.]

## Conclusion

[Insert a brief summary of the findings and any conclusions that can be drawn from the results.]

## References

[Insert any references or citations here, including the paper that this project is based on.]
