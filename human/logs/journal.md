Chat #1 - ChatGPT Model: Default (GPT-3.5) (March 22, 2023)

I'm reading through a paper right now and I want to implement its algorithm myself. Here's the abstract:

Tabular datasets are the last “unconquered castle” for deep learning, with traditional
ML methods like Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees still performing strongly even
against recent specialized neural architectures. In this paper, we hypothesize that
the key to boosting the performance of neural networks lies in rethinking the joint
and simultaneous application of a large set of modern regularization techniques.
As a result, we propose regularizing plain Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks
by searching for the optimal combination/cocktail of 13 regularization techniques
for each dataset using a joint optimization over the decision on which regularizers
to apply and their subsidiary hyperparameters.
We empirically assess the impact of these regularization cocktails for MLPs in a
large-scale empirical study comprising 40 tabular datasets and demonstrate that
(i) well-regularized plain MLPs significantly outperform recent state-of-the-art
specialized neural network architectures, and (ii) they even outperform strong
traditional ML methods, such as XGBoost.

I don't want to run it over 40 tabular datasets, just scikit-learn's california housing dataset. What I want to implement is their regularizations, optimization scheme, and a framework for comparing the regularized neural networks with xgboost. Let's begin with a README.md for the repository

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a template for a README.md file that you can use:

Great! What should the commit be called?

Here are a few suggestions for commit names:

    Initial commit: Setting up project structure
===============
The formatting didn't translate great, I'll think about how to manage this better. But here's my takeaway: nice! It has a nicely formatted README with a lot of spots for the different sections that will eventually be useful. I'll be filling in these details with the model later on. It wrapped its second response in triple backticks like I asked, but the web app kind of ruined my hope of a single copy and paste. 


==============
I took a detour today and decided to make a couple extensions that would help with this workflow and writing these logs. The first extension is for VSCode. It copies the entired codebase to my clipboard which allows me to paste it quickly into the chatGPT interface. 


Chat #2.1 - Model GPT4 (March 25, 2023)

I want to make a vscode extension that makes it easy to copy and paste code in plaintext. I want it to have the following structure

`file1.py`
```
[file1 contents here]
```

To create a Visual Studio Code extension that helps users copy and paste code in plaintext format, follow these steps:

    Install prerequisites:
        Node.js (https://nodejs.org/)
        Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    Install Yeoman and the Visual Studio Code Extension generator:

    css

npm install -g yo generator-code

Run the generator to create a new extension:

css

yo code

Follow the prompts and choose the following options:

    "New Extension (TypeScript)"
    Provide a name for your extension, like "plaintext-copier"
    Add a brief description
    Accept the default location for the extension files

Change to the extension directory:

bash

cd plaintext-copier

Open the extension in Visual Studio Code:

css

    code .

    Open src/extension.ts file, and add your functionality to the activate function. The following example code will add a command to copy the active file's content in the desired format:

typescript

import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import * as fs from 'fs';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    let disposable = vscode.commands

midnijtcontent@gmail.com
please finish the `extenion.ts` file

Here is the complete extension.ts file with the added functionality to copy the active file's content in the desired format:

typescript

import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('plaintext-copier.copyAsPlainText', async () => {
        const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
        if (!editor) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No active text editor found');
            return;
        }

        const document = editor.document;
        const fileName = path.basename(document.fileName);
        const fileContent = document.getText();

        const plainText = `\`${fileName}\`\n\`\`\`\n${fileContent}\n\`\`\``;

        await vscode.env.clipboard.writeText(plainText);
        vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Code copied in plain text format');
    });

    context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
}

export function deactivate() {}

This code registers a command called plaintext-copier.copyAsPlainText that:

    Checks if there is an active text editor
    Retrieves the file name and its content
    Formats the content in the desired plain text format
    Copies the formatted content to the clipboard

midnijtcontent@gmail.com
now can you make it copy the entire codebase instead of just the active file?

Sure! To copy the entire codebase instead of just the active file, you can modify the extension.ts file as follows:

typescript

import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

async function readDirectoryRecursive(directory: string, relativePath = ''): Promise<string> {
    const entries = await fs.promises.readdir(directory, { withFileTypes: true });
    let plainText = '';

    for (const entry of entries) {
        const entryPath = path.join(directory, entry.name);
        const relativeEntryPath = path.join(relativePath, entry.name);

        if (entry.isFile()) {
            const fileContent = await fs.promises.readFile(entryPath, 'utf-8');
            plainText += `\`${relativeEntryPath}\`\n\`\`\`\n${fileContent}\n\`\`\`\n\n`;
        } else if (entry.isDirectory()) {
            plainText += await readDirectoryRecursive(entryPath, relativeEntryPath);
        }
    }

    return plainText;
}

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('plaintext-copier.copyEntireCodebase', async () => {
        const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders;

        if (!workspaceFolders || workspaceFolders

midnijtcontent@gmail.com
whats the rest?

Apologies for the incomplete response. Here's the rest of the extension.ts file:

typescript

import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';

async function readDirectoryRecursive(directory: string, relativePath = ''): Promise<string> {
    const entries = await fs.promises.readdir(directory, { withFileTypes: true });
    let plainText = '';

    for (const entry of entries) {
        const entryPath = path.join(directory, entry.name);
        const relativeEntryPath = path.join(relativePath, entry.name);

        if (entry.isFile()) {
            const fileContent = await fs.promises.readFile(entryPath, 'utf-8');
            plainText += `\`${relativeEntryPath}\`\n\`\`\`\n${fileContent}\n\`\`\`\n\n`;
        } else if (entry.isDirectory()) {
            plainText += await readDirectoryRecursive(entryPath, relativeEntryPath);
        }
    }

    return plainText;
}

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('plaintext-copier.copyEntireCodebase', async () => {
        const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders;

        if (!workspaceFolders || workspaceFolders.length === 0) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage

midnijtcontent@gmail.com
finish the `activate` function

Apologies for the abrupt ending again. Here is the complete activate function:

typescript

export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('plaintext-copier.copyEntireCodebase', async () => {
        const workspaceFolders = vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders;

        if (!workspaceFolders || workspaceFolders.length === 0) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No open workspace found');
            return;
        }

        if (workspaceFolders.length > 1) {
            vscode.window.showErrorMessage('This extension only supports single-root workspaces');
            return;
        }

        const workspacePath = workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath;
        const plainText = await readDirectoryRecursive(workspacePath);

        await vscode.env.clipboard.writeText(plainText);
        vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Entire codebase copied in plain text format');
    });

    context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
}

In this updated activate function, the extension will now check if there is a single open workspace. If there are multiple workspaces or no workspace, it will show an appropriate error message. If there's a single workspace, the extension will read the entire codebase using the readDirectoryRecursive function and copy it to the clipboard in the specified format.

now that i have `extension.ts` done, how do i use it?

Once you have finished editing the extension.ts file, you can test and use your extension within Visual Studio Code using the following steps:

    Run the extension in the Extension Development Host: Press F5 or go to Run > Start Debugging in the menu. This will open a new instance of Visual Studio Code called the "Extension Development Host" with your extension loaded.

    Test the functionality of your extension: In the Extension Development Host, open a folder or a project. To use your extension, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P), then search for and run the command named "Copy Entire Codebase as Plain Text". Your extension should now copy the entire codebase to your clipboard in the specified format.

    Make any changes if necessary: If you find any issues or want to make improvements, go back to the original Visual Studio Code window where you're developing the extension. Update the code, save your changes, and press F5 again to reload the Extension Development Host with your updated extension.

    **Package the

midnijtcontent@gmail.com
I don't see the command named "Copy Entire Codebase as Plain Text". Do I have to compile the extension first?

Apologies for the confusion. You don't need to compile the extension first, but you do need to update the package.json file to register the command for your extension.

In the package.json file, locate the contributes section and add the following:

json

"commands": [
  {
    "command": "plaintext-copier.copyEntireCodebase",
    "title": "Copy Entire Codebase as Plain Text"
  }
]

Your package.json should look something like this:

json

{
  "name": "plaintext-copier",
  "displayName": "Plaintext Copier",
  "description": "A simple extension to copy the entire codebase as plain text",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "engines": {
    "vscode": "^1.62.0"
  },
  "categories": [
    "Other"
  ],
  "activationEvents": [
    "onCommand:plaintext-copier.copyEntireCodebase"
  ],
  "main": "./out/extension.js",
  "contributes": {

It's working but it's pulling out a lot of files I don't care about. How do I restrict it to only return `.py` files?

To restrict the output to only .py files, you can update the readDirectoryRecursive function in the extension.ts file. You can add a condition to check the file extension before adding its content to the plain text output. Modify the function like this:

typescript

async function readDirectoryRecursive(directory: string, relativePath = ''): Promise<string> {
    const entries = await fs.promises.readdir(directory, { withFileTypes: true });
    let plainText = '';

    for (const entry of entries) {
        const entryPath = path.join(directory, entry.name);
        const relativeEntryPath = path.join(relativePath, entry.name);

        if (entry.isFile()) {
            const fileExtension = path.extname(entryPath);
            if (fileExtension === '.py') {
                const fileContent = await fs.promises.readFile(entryPath, 'utf-8');
                plainText += `\`${relativeEntryPath}\`\n\`\`\`\n${fileContent}\n\`\`\`\n\n`;
            }
        } else if (entry.isDirectory()) {
            plainText += await readDirectoryRecursive(entryPath, relativeEntryPath);
        }
    }

    return plainText;
}

Great! Now that the extension is working how I want, how do I make it a permanent part of my vs code?

To make your extension a permanent part of your VS Code, you'll need to package and install it as a .vsix file. Follow these steps:

    Install the vsce tool: The vsce command-line tool is used to package and publish extensions. Install it using the following command:

npm install -g vsce

Package the extension: Open the terminal in the directory where your extension's package.json is located, and run the following command to package your extension:

go

    vsce package

    This command will create a .vsix file in the same directory (e.g., plaintext-copier-0.0.1.vsix).

    Install the extension: Open Visual Studio Code, and then click on the Extensions view icon or press Ctrl+Shift+X (Cmd+Shift+X on macOS) to open the Extensions panel. Click on the three-dot menu in the top-right corner and choose "Install from VSIX...". In the file picker, navigate to the .vsix file you created in step 2, and click "Install".

Your extension is now installed as a permanent part of your VS Code. You can use it just like any other extension you

VS Code Extension: Copy Codebase
===============
It works!! I've never made a VSCode extension before much less written in javascript. This is hugely impressive.

Now I'm going to try making the second: a chrome extension that will copy the chatgpt chat in a well-formatted way to improve these logs

... After much back and forth I couldn't get it to work. Likely because I couldn't formulate the problem correctly given that the webpage uses javascript to load in the conversations :(
