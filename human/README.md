This is where I, the human, will be writing my thoughts, impressions, etc.. Assume everything outside of this folder is written by some AI model. Things within this folder are written by a human unless otherwise specified. 

In `Logs/` I'll keep notes of my workflow and conversations with the AI chatbots I had in order to make this codebase.
